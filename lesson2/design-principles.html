        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p>Marietta Adventure Company<br><br><a href="https://www.mariettaadventurecompany.com">mariettaadventurecompany.com</a></p>

        <p>
          The Marietta Adventure Company website is a good example of
          repetition. As I navigated through the site I noticed that the
          different pages all used the same style for the naviation menu. Also,
          from this screenshot you can see that the buttons are all the same
          color, size, shape, and have the same font. If you were to scroll down
          the page you would see that there are several images with buttons and
          text overlaid. Each image is the same size. The bottons and font are
          the same on each image. This repetition helps tie it all together and
          makes the page look consistent and pleasing to the eye.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>Pongathon<br><br><a href="https://pongathon.com/">pongathon.com</a></p>
        <img src="images/pongathon300.jpg" />
        <p>
          The Pongathon website is a good example of contrast. The color of the
          background is very different from the color of the text. This makes
          the text easy to read. The big buttons on the bottom are much larger
          than the other items on the page. This makes them stand out and draw
          the users attention to them. Also when you hover the mouse over them
          they change to a black background with white text. This give a sharp
          contrast between the active and non-active buttons.

        <h3>Proximity</h3>
        <p>Family Tree Dental<br><br><a href="https://familytreedentist.com/">familytreedentist.com</a></p>
        <img src="images/ftd300.jpg" />
        <p>
          The Family Tree Dental website is a good example of using the
          proximity design principle. At the top of the page all of the
          locations are listed together. This helps the user see all of the
          location information in one place. Also, not far from the location
          information is the "Schedule Appointment" button. This is placed close
          to the top of the page, not far from the location information. All of
          this helps to encourage the visitor to make an appointment and
          facilitates the process right at the begining of the page. This helps
          the patient to get the process started for getting the care they need.
          It also helps the practice get new patients to make an appointment.
