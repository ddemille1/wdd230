      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website is to promote and provide information about the services offered by Temple Inn and Suites. Temple Inn and Suites is a hotel chain catering to the needs of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who are attending or working at the temple. As such the website will have a temple theme and reflect the culture of the church. It will have a neat and clean appearance consistent with the order and cleanliness found in the temple. The website will provide a way for potential guests to reserve a room, suite, or reception area.</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience of the website is the potential customers of Temple Inn and Suites. Potential customers would be temple patrons, workers, and their families. More specificially this would be groups traveling long distances to attend the temple who needed accomodations. Another audience is people who have done temple marraiges and would thus need a reception venue. It would also be full-time temple missionaries who need long term accomodations near the temple.</p>
