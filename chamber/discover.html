                    The River Trail is currently 3.28 miles. The first phase of the project, which runs from Indian Acres Boat Ramp to the Putnam Street Bridge, was completed in 2005. The second phase extended the trail from the bridge, along Post Street, Ohio Street, and then along the Levee to South Fourth Street. The third phase extends from South Fourth Street to Jefferson Street, behind K-Mart. The Trail now runs from the Indian Acres Boat Ramp along the river - all the way to East 8th and Jefferson Streets, behind K-Mart. Phase 5 of the Trail is currently in the funding stage and will extend to Wal-Mart.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Established in 1788, Marietta is the oldest city in the state of Ohio, and the first official American settlement territory north and west of the Ohio River. Known as the “Riverboat Town,” it is located at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers. Washington County’s earliest visitors arrived more than 2,000 years ago, and today thousands of visitors continue to come to the area each year to enjoy its charm, natural beauty, flowing rivers and rich heritage.</p>
